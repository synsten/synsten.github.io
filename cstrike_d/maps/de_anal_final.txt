Just an ordinary gas station - Bomb/Defuse
Final Version 3.0
by Cmdr

A nice, little gas station in a german city. 
Two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, are spawning here
and... Let's see what they have to do...

Terrorists:
One of our team has found a bomb in his inventory.
Look, there is a gasstation! Let's make a huge fireball and have fun!

Counter-Terrorists:
Well, this is a DE-map. So we guess the terrorists will plant a bomb somewhere.
Try to find this bomb and defuse it, before all this will gonna blow.

Other notes:
What have you suspected by the map name?
This is just an ordinary gas station!
